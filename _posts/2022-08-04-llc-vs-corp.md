title: 'Decision: Should I create an LLC or a Corp?'
---

This seems to be a pretty basic question that anyone wanting to open a business
faces. There are plenty of resources available on the Web for arriving at a
decision. And the correct answer is ... it depends on your situation.

For my case, let me start with my criteria:

1.  I want to try some hobby type business ideas - publish a game, create a
    website, do part-time gigs (e.g., Uber, Doordash), list a car on Turo, etc.

2.  I want to have a legal entity tied to business accounts, to keep them
    separate from personal accounts.

3.  I want to avoid any type of personal liability due to any business lawsuits.

4.  I don’t expect to take Venture Funding for this entity.

5.  I don’t expect the entity to make a lot of money, if any.

I consulted these sources for information:

I collected these facts:

Pros of LLC:

-   LLC provides similar Legal protections as a Corporation, but lets you run
    your company as a small business.

-   LLC allows pass-through treatment of income taxes, so tax filing is simpler.

-   Corporations have double-taxation - Corporate Tax plus Individual Income
    Tax.

-   Corporations require more overhead, like issuing shares, having a Board of
    Directors, etc.

-   A loss earned by an LLC may generally be used to offset income of the owners
    during the same tax year, for example, income from employment.

-   An LLC can always convert to a C-Corp later - this is what Facebook did.

Cons of LLC:

-   LLCs cannot go public.

-   LLCs are not recognized globally.

-   Investors prefer Corporations.

I arrived at the following conclusion: Create an LLC, not C-Corp.
