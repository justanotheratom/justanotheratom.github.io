title: 'Decisions: Creating an LLC'
---

Looks like these days there is a plethora of nice looking online Services to
help you quickly setup a business online. This, however, brings up the paradox
of choice and the resulting decision making. Maybe it is not too complicated
after all. Its just that I would like to minimize any issues down the line. This
blog post is my attempt to write down my reasoning when creating my first ever
LLC, so my future self can hopefully learn from any mistakes.

### Decision: Incorporate in Home State or Delaware?

Stripe Atlas seems to only support creating an LLC in Delaware. One reason for
this might be that it is geared towards Startups, and any Startups that may grow
enough to need Venture funding could easily convert from Delaware LLC to
Delaware Corp at a later date. Or maybe they just want to make money exploiting
the fact that out of state owners of Delaware LLC will end up using Stripe as
their Registered Agent in Delaware.

Stripe’s [documentation](https://stripe.com/docs/atlas/next#taxes) leaves the
problem for the customer to figure out:

>   If your company operates in any U.S. states other than Delaware, it might be
>   subject to annual taxation, registration, and reporting requirements in the
>   other states. Stripe recommends that you consult legal and tax professionals
>   about what requirements apply to your business.

According to [LLC
University](https://www.llcuniversity.com/best-state-to-form-an-llc/), best
state to form your LLC is your home state. Otherwise, you have to register a
“Foreign LLC” in your home state, which means you end up paying twice for State
Filing, Registered Agent, and Annual Report. And you have to pay taxes where the
money is made, so technically this would be the home state.

Decision: I will create LLC in my home state. This does imply that I cannot use
Stripe Atlas, which is a bummer because it is the brand I recognize the most.

### Decision: Should I pay for a Registered Agent?

States require a Registered Agent with a physical address to receive official
notices - lawsuits, subpoenas, etc. Most Services charge anywhere from \$100 to
\$299 per year to be a Registered Agent for your LLC.

Decision: I am going to register myself with my personal address as the Agent.
At the risk of my name and address getting publicly listed with the LLC, I have
the optionality to pay for a Registered Agent later.

### Decision: Who should own the LLC - me, or spouse, or me+spouse?

If the entity ends up making money, I would like any self-employment taxes to go
towards my spouse’s Social Security contributions, to satisfy her Work Credits.
It is important for a person to satisfy Social Security Work Credits in order to
qualify for Disability Benefits if the need arises.

So I should go with spouse or me+spouse.

Now, having a husband+wife partnership LLC makes tax filings a little
complicated. See

[Qualified Joint Venture LLC [Husband and Wife LLC] - LLC
University​.](tps://www.llcuniversity.com/irs/qualified-joint-venture-husband-wife-llc/)

Since we are living in Washington state, which is a Community Property State, we
can do a Qualified Joint Venture election with the IRS to get around the tax
filing issue. However, this is not future proof, in case we move to some other
state.

So, I have decided to go with 100% spouse ownership.

### Decision: Which online Service should I use for creating the LLC?

Below are the Services that I considered:

-   LegalZoom

-   Clerky

-   IncFile

-   NorthWest Registered Agent

-   Stripe Atlas - Only files in Delaware.

-   Collective Hub - Only handles S-Corp.

Decision: I am proceeding with using IncFile because it is free. I will have to
file separately to get an IRS TIN, and a Washington State Business License.

 

These are the action items after LLC Formation:

1.  Get an Email account.

2.  Get an IRS TIN - [How to get an EIN for LLC (Online) [2022 Guide] \| LLC

    Corp - S Corp Election Form 2553

4.  Get a Washington Business License - [Business License in Washington \| LLC

    -   [Redmond \| Washington Department of
        Revenue](https://dor.wa.gov/manage-business/city-license-endorsements/redmond)

5.  Get a Business Bank Account.

6.  Get a Virtual Phone Number.

7.  Get a Small Business Credit Card - [Blue Business Plus Credit Card from

    Express​](https://www.americanexpress.com/us/credit-cards/business/business-credit-cards/american-express-blue-business-plus-credit-card-amex/45094/?linknav=US-Acq-GCP-BusinessCards-ViewAllCards-CardTitle-BlueForBusinessPlus)

 

I am going to figure out these open questions later:

1.  How to do bookkeeping?

2.  How to cheaply file taxes, especially when the revenue for the year is
    minimal or zero?
